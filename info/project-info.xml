When you want to have fun and get messy, hit M, and this will build some bacteria on your hand. The bacteria will run around and get hungry, searching for the food on your hand. If a bacteria doesnt eat in time it dies. Ocassionally, the bacteria will reproduce.&#10;You can hit F to randomly give the bacteria more food.&#10;You can hit D to randomly delete food.&#10;You can hit S to put soap on your hand. This will only kill bacteria which are not resistant.&#10;At a certain point you will get sick, and if you get too sick you die. Your goal, though, is too create an epidemic where ultra-resistant bacteria get too numerous and can take over the world!" tags="Evolutionary Pressure, Evolution, Natural Selection" uuid="B0F2B70A-1B63-491F-A4F1-D6F1A3D6000054A3"/>
